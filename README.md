# Writing

This is a folder for writing and wondering about life and stuff, all in plain text just to make things easier in the long run.

There will be a couple files here, all in markdown, although I don't think I will upload this folder to github, I just enjoy writing in atom and there has been quite a long time since the last i've wrote.

So, It's on github. I will use this repo to backup the files I want to keep from my blog before closing it for good, the on the topic series has been moved to the respective folder, the other folder has the Written on a Typewriter series.

There it is, the whole written on a typewriter series, for whoever wants to read. I will start a new series just for getting stuff off my chest, thinking of a name for it right now.

About Machines is my new series, as always, the title is three times better than the content, have fun friends. =)
