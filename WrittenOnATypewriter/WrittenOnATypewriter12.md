Hey there guys, this week I've decided to take a tour of Washington DC, it's a really cool looking place, I just need to buy a few cans of bug spray, the giant roaches are seriously creeping me out.

Obviously I'm talking about fallout 3 this week,never been to Washington, and beside a few Google photos that have crossed my eye I have never even seen it, and I'm sure that the roaches are not nearly as big of a problem as they are in the game.

For those people not in the know, there is an annual event called E3 that all the gamers watch and pretty much the reason for me being a journalist, this year's E3 came and went and Bethesda dropped a treat on us that everyone loved, Fallout 4, the game is looking remarkably good, with tons of cool and astonishing features such as in depth customisation and meaningful companions, and as the good guy that I am I went and bought both Fallout 3 and New Vegas to play over the weekend hence the visit to DC.

Fallout 3 starts the way all games should, with a tutorial you don't want to skip, and keeps the pace from there, roaming the desolate landscape of post apocalyptic Washington feels like it should, the things you do and the things you don't do impact the world around you in deep meaningful ways and whether you like it of not, the only person that still likes you in the moment you step out of the tutorial is your father.

Fallout 3 is a lesson on good game design and every one, gamer or not, should play through it at least once, it deserved all the game of the year nominations and prizes it got, and kept us hooked on it for long enough for them to work on New Vegas. There is a longer gap between New Vegas and Fallout 4, but hopefully the time is justified in the upcoming months, the game will be released in October, and until then I will keep playing fallout 3 and new Vegas exhaustively. But then again,  don't take my word for it, go and try it yourself, if there is one company that deserves your money, that company is Bethesda, and you might even join the Hype Train for Fallout 4.
