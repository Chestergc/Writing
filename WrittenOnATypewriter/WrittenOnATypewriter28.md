Hey there guys. This week something terrible and unthinkable happened, I broke my phone's screen. Yep, i also have no older phones to use, gave the last one to my girlfriend, you may think that I am desperate, and i definitely am, but there is a single feature in my Moto X that almost made me get in a plane to kiss someone at the company.

I, like most people, have a lot of information on my phone, sensitive information that should never fall into the wrong hands, pretty much everything that I have ever done is in my phone. But unlike most people I have all the important stuff backed up in seven different places, because I'm that much of a paranoid. Yes I know that probably no one would use the information in my phone for anything but I will ever give it to anyone.

Inside my phone there are my books, all the photos I have ever taken (which is about eight gig) my comics, my drawings, even the schematics for some things that I have done in the past, or intend to do in the future, making it the second most valuable piece of equipment I have ever owned, displaced only by my notebook.

In the moment I realised that the screen didn't work anymore I got kind of desperate, I can't send it to be repaired with all my stuff in it. what will people think of me if they see all the photos of weird stuff that I have, or the weirdly commercial music I am into. I need to erase my phones memory.

But there was a problem, my phone is password protected, so I can't just plug it into a computer and delete everything, because the phone needs to be unlocked for me to do that. And without the screen I can't unlock it.

Then I remembered that motorola offers a service where you can trigger a remote wipe for your phone, in case it's stolen. I immediately connected to motorola's website and tried to log in, and again I have forgot to turn on the feature in my phone. (Seriously the second time I need it and had not turned it on) Well, i'm doomed. Google help me.

After a couple minutes browsing I figured out that the Android studio haves a remote trigger function, that allows me to emulate commands in the phone from the software, so I spent a couple minutes downloading the latest version of android studio and trying to find the phone drivers in the motorola website.

After I had downloaded and installed Android Studio and the pertinent drivers I connected my phone and tried the simple shell commands using the supplied program to try and connect to my phone. Needless to say, it didn't work. At that point I almost gave up. Honestly that else can I do? I have absolutely no way of unlocking my phone, or wiping it for that matter, and since Motorola doesn't believe that we need external memory cards, I can't just remove the information that is in there.

Then my phone rang. A lightbulb lit up above my head and I pretty much shouted "OK GOOGLE". Yep, the most useless feature my phone has, the single one that I have never used, was how I got to delete my phones internal memory. I just asked for some random web page, it asked for my password, I said it and there it was, the phone connected, the files erased, and my mind at ease.

I will now send it to be repaired, and hopefully by next week I can turn on the remote wipe feature, or forget to do so again. Who knows? The only thing i'm sure is that the voice activation feature that motorola decided to put in the phone was the single most useful thing I could have ever had in that moment. If you stop to thin about it, phones are pretty fallible contraptions, if the screen is gone there is absolutely no other way to interface with them, most times you can't even connect a screen, and let's be honest, no one has those usb on the go things, and I will probably not get one.

Well that was it, the most useless feature ever saved my precious information from being shared with random people in the internet. I hope you enjoyed this week's column, as always thank you so much for reading, and until next week.
