Hey there guys, so Fallout 4 came out already, finally, and I played a couple hours of it and thank god the power amor training thing has been kicked off the game, as soon as you find a power armor you can use it, I think that is because of the former military training the main character had before the great war, in any case as soon as I got into the power armor I began to wonder why is it that we don't have them nowadays, I mean it seems pretty simple to make, the hardest part would be the movement prediction, and we got pretty good at that because of the rovers we sent to mars, then I started looking around and well, we do have power armor, it just goes by another name, EVA Suit.

Well yeah, it is not exactly layers and layers of metal being supported by a couple hundred hydraulic struts and powered by cold fusion technology, but it still is power armor, think about it, it is a complete suit of armor that covers your whole body and provides resistance to radiation and "gun shots"(astronauts get hit by micro asteroids all the time), it has a life support system and all else you may suppose soldiers might need. Well it is expensive as all hell, if I recall correctly every suit is custom made for the astronauts and costs about half a million each, but so is the power armor in the games, it is a specialised military suit made for troops and only for troops, it is not until the great war has come and gone that civilians started to be able to use it, and still only people related to either the Brotherhood or the Enclave.

That is not exactly what I want though, if you think about power armor objectively it is a transportation system, like a motorcycle for a single person (although it is often compared to single person tanks) and it could be really useful for todays world, with all the empty four seat cars that go around everywhere. So how would a suit of power armor get into the consumer market? There are a few things that it would need to do better than cars and motorcycles, but it is not impossible, bare with me for a little while.

For the armor to be accepted in the consumer market we live in it would have to be more useful than a car or a motorcycle, be a either a replacement for your regular clothes or have space enough to fit a fully dressed person inside, it can't be intrusive to your life style, you should not need to take it off to go inside places and obviously it must not be considered a weapon.

Power armor is huge, way bigger than any clothing used in the last five hundred years, and that is a problem, if the armor is too big you will run into trouble when trying to get inside a structure a regular person would be able to enter, so it haves to be smaller, like Stark's armor, adding just a couple centimetres to your over all height and width.

It has to be more useful than a car or a motorcycle, if you own or owned a car you know what i'm talking about, you need to fill it up every couple days with gas and if you need to go inside some place you must find somewhere to park your obnoxiously big metal box outside the structure you are visiting and pay for parking. A good consumer set of power armor has to be better than that, recharging it over night when you are at home would be great, if it could make you sprint faster it would be awesome, if it could fly it would be perfect, the point being that it has to be more useful than a car or a bike because that would be the price range it would be hitting, making a power armor would be expensive, but if you look at vehicle prices in general it would be relatively easy to imagine a contraption that falls into that price range.

And then you get to the possibly hardest part, go on the internet right now and take a look at every power armor set you can find, be it from Fallout, Halo, Metroid, Iron Man, anywhere, all sets of power armor are really intrusive, you can't see yourself wearing it to a business meeting without being called an "eccentric millionaire" or even on day to day life, if you go to a coffee shop and see a person wearing a huge metal armor you will feel really bad and keep thinking that something bad will happen. "Why is that guy wearing armor? Is someone trying to kill him? I should get out of here." You can see where this is going, sadly you might need someone way smarter than me to find a solution to that, the only thing I can think of is covering the metal parts with cloth or leather, which could work, but would bring some engineering problems with it, like heat management and parts getting stuck in the cloth.

But then again, although I can think of a million uses for power armor in the consumer market, it will always be tied to the military, it is after all an armor piece, there is nothing you can do about that, and that is why there is almost no one in the private market trying to develop it. Yeah, it sucks, I wanted one so badly and I will never see one in real life, but hey, at least it was fun to think about it for a couple hours while thinking about this column, I can even picture myself going to the super market in a suit of cloth covered power armor, flying to the door and walking in, without worrying about parking the car or anything, it would be awesome. As always guys, thank you for reading this weeks column and if you can think of a suit that fits all the requisites for a consumer lever power armor feel free to share it with me on twitter @trymeguilherme, until next week guys.
