Hey there guys. A days ago I've heard about something that got me thinking about physics again, yep, it's going to be one of those days, feel free to skip this one if you don't want to learn about the probably wrong interpretations I have on random physics subjects.

In modern physics we have a concept called "Alcubierre Drive", named after the guy that came up with the idea, Miguel Alcubierre, is a theoretical construct made to go around the laws of physics and "Breaking" the cosmical speed limit set by the speed of light. You have totally seen it before in one place or another, you just didn't knew that there were some scientists that took the idea seriously.

Think about Star Wars, you are there on your cozy little place in the Alderaan, chilling by the swamp, with your drink and something to eat probably, and then you get a holo message from a distant cousin, he is getting married in a couple weeks and he wants you to attend to his marriage, the only problem is that he lives in coruscant. That's about seven systems away, how the hell do you get there? The short answer is, with our current technology, you don't.

But there is a way, call a couple friends, they will point you to a captain that is going to make the run in a couple days, you get inside the ship, he engages his warp drives and you're there in half an hour. Amazing huh? It must be science fiction only, a trick to get people to different worlds in time for the next plot event, but you'd be wrong.

That's where the Alcubierre drive comes in, as I've stated before, the drive is a theoretical construct that allows faster than light travel by going around the laws instead of obeying them. The drive itself has been thought about in a couple different ways, there is the way Alcubierre thought about it, the way NASA thought about it, and then there is the way a random guy in his garage is thinking about it.

The point that is nailed across the board in all of them is that there is a speed limit for information to travel, but there is not a limit for the speed that space travels, that is the main point in inflation and why most of the universe is lost to us.

The idea Alcubierre came up with was basically a gravity bubble, contracting the space in front of the craft and expanding the space behind it, the sad thing was that for the drive to be stable you would need "Exotic matter", (nope, not a clue as to what that is) and you would need a lot of it, all of the matter in the observable universe based on the original calculations.

"There has to be a better way" thought NASA's scientist Dr. Harold White, and so he started crunching up numbers and redesigning the ship and drive, and got to the point where he thinks you would need as little as a Voyager space craft's mass worth of energy to get the warp bubble stable enough for a space craft to use it.

And then we get to that "Guy in a garage" that I told you about a couple paragraphs ago, his name is Dave Pares, he is the founder and president of Space Warp Dynamics, and yes, the name of the company made me giggly for a couple minutes.

He is a scientist, a teacher for a couple different universities and he thinks that he may have a grasp on the basics of the warp technology, and according to his published material, it works.

His idea came about when he was hearing about a guy that that seemingly "Warped" a couple miles away from the position he was when he was flying over the Bahamas (Yes i mean the Bermuda triangle, not using that name here though), the pilot went into record to say that he couldn't have travelled the distance he had in the amount of time he took to do so, and specially without using the fuel needed for the trip. That was interesting enough to catch Mr. Pares attention and he began thinking about it, what do clouds have that we don't use every day, the first conclusion he took was: they have magnetic fields.

And then he set out to build it, here is a video from a channel I like a lot talking to the guy and showing some of his previous results:

>The Good Stuff's Channel (A part of PBS digital) talking about Dave's warp drive.

What he did was basically simulate the electromagnetic field a storm has and point it towards the ground, pretty simple experiment, and a great proof of concept, even if it is just that, making an engine that does not depend on fuel, especially for flying, is amazing, it may not make all that much difference because well, there is a lot of energy involved in the experiment and it may not be viable for actual usable vehicles, but we may as well be seeing the beginning of the flying car revolution, or even the first steps of the hover board. Just that alone is awesome. In any case don't take my word for it, it is still just a proof of concept, a good and inspiring one, but still just that.

And there you go, yes i'm kind of skeptical about it as well, but still the results he showed are very impressive, he may actually be pulling down on earth itself using the magnetic field, I would like to see the experiment turned upside down to see the results, but that is still awesome, I wan't to go to mars and retire there, so please Mr. Pares, make it work. As always guys, thank you for reading this week's column, feel free to share your thought with me through twitter @trymeguilherme and until next week.
