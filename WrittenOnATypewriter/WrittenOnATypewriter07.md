So, you guys may have noticed that I am a little late with this week's update. That happened because I have decided to take up the most time consuming hobby in the universe, Pixel Art.

For those that don't know what that is, it is a very cool way of doing art, imitating old video games, in almost the way that they were made. Painting pixel by pixel, shading with colors instead of automated tools, even doing anti aliasing by hand. It is one of the coolest things I have ever done in my life.

Pretty much any tool for drawing you have in your computer is good for Pixel art, Photoshop, GIMP even MS Paint works really well, I mean eventually someone would find a use for the damn thing. You start with a couple line sketches, of whatever you are doing, a tree, a house, anything, then you color a bit, and shade, everything pixel by pixel. You would not believe the amount of time it takes to make a single picture.

My first try was a mockup for a project I want to make in the future, I have started to work on it yesterday at noon, finished it a couple minutes ago. it was basically twelve hours drawing, with a couple stops here and there to use the bathroom or even drink a cup of coffee and eat something. The end result though, astonishing.

I couldn't even believe what my hands had made, as some of you may know I am not a great designer, or painter for that matter, but let me tell you, at the end of the day I was proud of my job, That is pretty rare when it comes to drawing, but taking my time and knowing what I wanted to accomplish I have made the finest work of art I have ever made in my life.

The moment I finished the drawing I just sat back in my chair and stared at the screen for about forty minutes. That's how much I liked it. Listening to music and deciding pixels is most definitely my favorite hobby right now. Who knows, I might even make a game eventually with the pixel art I am making.

But as always, don't take my word for it, go and try, when you see the amazing artworks in the web just be sure people took moths to make them, be patient, try out every pixel before deciding and then if you don't like pixel art at the end of the day, blame it on me. Thank you for reading and have a nice week.
