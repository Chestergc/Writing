Hey there guys. This week has been weird for me. Not a lot to do, so I thought about random stuff, but the one that caught me the longest was perspective on cameras and how people translate that into 2d interpretations of the world.

Have any of you ever seen one of those isometric pixel art drawings? That is what I'm talking about. I've found a couple artists that work in that stile for a living and was impressed with the way they treat their art. Doing isometric drawing gs save time. They reuse so many assets from their drawings that you could say they spend their days creating stuff to put in pictures.

You can't do that with a camera. Isometric drawings don't have perspective, there is no blur the faster along you look. Or distortion. So there is absolutely no way to have a isometric photograph. Which  is really sad.

The other way people portrait the world in 2d is the awesome side scrolling stuff. It is no way near realistic, but it institutes a clear goal for the character. The bad thing being that none of the scenarios are realistic. They can be based off of real places, but that is as far as it goes.

The point being that photography is the best way to record a 3d world in a 2d plane, and there is a lot of fun to be had by trying to emulate those locked perspectives in a photograph. But then again don't trust me, pull out your phone and try to shoot an isometric and a side scroller picture. Until next week guys.
