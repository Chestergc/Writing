Hey there guys, writing this one a day earlier, I know, weird right? It's just that i'm anticipating the time I will spend playing tomorrow and the day after. I'm not very sure if I have mentioned this on the column before but I was able to purchase my very first analog Synth, It's an Arturia Microbrute, I know, not exactly top of the line but hey, I liked it, and it was cheap. In any case the whole time it's taking for him to get here (yes I talk about my things as if they were people so what?) I've been looking around for stuff to buy afterwards and the quest was so fun that I thought I should share with you guys.

For those that don't know my music may ask why the hell would I buy an analog synth, first of all, listen to this:

That is the kind of music I make, so yeah, Synths and stuff, mostly stuff but there are also synths. The first synthesizer that i used was actually my cellphone, with Caustic 3, it's a pretty cool application that can introduce almost anyone to synthesis with a clean interface and even a simple mix/master section, that is what started me on the make weird music for weird people kind of thing, I wrote a couple albums on the phone (a Moto G back in the day) and decided to save some money for an actual synth. The prices of actual synths being so high I decided to buy a good digital synth first, to see if I like it as much as I thought i did, so I went and downloaded the ridiculously amazing digital synth Animoog, you can even guess why I had payed the thirty something bucks the app cost in the moment I wanted to use it, I even downloaded a few of the expansion packs and ever since there has not been even one song I wrote that has not had a synth.

But even Animoog being the most awesome new kind of synthesizer I had heard in years, I still wanted my very own Sub 37.

"Yeah good luck with that one dude" you may say, and you are totally right.

I live in Brasil, the land of sun and kids playing soccer and taxes. Seriously, have you ever payed a hundred and sixty percent import fee for anything? Yep. So the Sub 37 I wanted would get here for about three thousand dollars, way above my budget. Way above most people's budgets also. To be honest, anything that I buy has to be the cheapest possible so that I am actually able to pay for the fees. Following that mentality I bought a controller, a Maschine Micro, so that even though I could not have a good synth, I could play the software ones I had already purchased with some skill.

The Maschine is a great controller whether you like soft instruments or not, the controls are responsive and you can totally forget that you are using a computer if you want to, not me though, I would always stare at Ableton and keep Maschine running separate because I wanted to use Animoog as an audio track and not depend on the sounds that came with the Maschine software.

And from that I started expanding my software library for a while, even using the cinematic drums you can hear in the song I posted above, but I still wanted my analog synth.

That is when I found out that Arturia was an actual thing. Yeah no pictures of this one because I haven't took any. So Arturia is a synth company with a major selling point for me, they make awesome sounding gear for reasonably cheap prices. The Microbrute I bought for instance, was the same price I paid on the Maschine (not sure if overpriced controller or underpriced synthesizer but hey) So it was an actual no brainer whether or not I would buy it, and as every good synth enthusiast, I started browsing around for stuff I could plug the Brute on.

What made Animoog so good to use was the fact that it had everything in the app, even a delay and a reverb (that sounded amazing might I add) and because of the price point of the Brute there was no way they could fit a delay on there, and he is a single oscillator synth, so yeah, I needed some other stuff to make it sound as weird and interesting as Animoog.

Oh, it just occurred to me that most people may not have understood a word of the last paragraph. Sorry about that. You know when you go inside a room with nothing on it besides the four walls? There is that weird sound there and when you speak you can hear your voice bouncing back? That is reverb, delay is kind of the same, but you take the bouncing back, record it on a cassette tape and play it on top of you speaking so that it lasts longer. And lastly, a synthesizer as you might have seen, is an electronic instrument, there is a component inside one that vibrates at a set rate, and from that vibration you can sculpt your sound making it lower, higher, dirtier, and stuff like that, that component that vibrates is an oscillator, having just one of those means that for all intents and purposes you can only play one note at a time, or in the oscillators that have a sub oscillator, two notes, one being exactly one octave bellow, so the same note no matter what.

Now that that is taken care of, I started looking at Eurorack modules, found a company in Brasil that made them and decided that the Microbrute was my thing, later on when I had a little more money I would buy a couple modules and stack them on top of the Brute, to change the sound without having to buy a new one. You guys may have heard that name before, but most people don't remember what that means, basically an Eurorack is a set of modular components that compose a synthesizer, actually Eurorack is the way people decided to let the components work, the whole set of components makes up a modular synthesizer.

In any case I have found this company, [Electronic Music Works] (http://www.emwbrasil.com.br), that is from my country, (and everyone should go check out) and makes good sounding modules, the designs are not as creative as say Pittsburg Modular or Make Noise, but they make up for that, more than enough, in audio quality, and for me that is just another plus, because I won't have to pay importing fees and that is enough for me to buy a full rack from their company. They have all that I need, a couple more filters, (to shape the sound coming in) a couple more VCOs (Voltage controlled oscillators) and even a couple extras, like a noise module (to make most drum sounds on synthesizers people use noise as a frequency source) and a delay.

Everything was fine and beautiful for the longest time, until I found out Dreadbox was a thing. Damn it world, why do you do that to me?

Dreadbox is another company that makes mostly effects and other crazy stuff, but every now and then they go out of their way to make a synth or two, and boy have they. Just watch the first minute of this video:

You can tell that i'm drooling over the keyboard right? I mean come on, that is just the perfect backup for my Brute, It's a shame that it costs more than the brute does. So right now what is going through my mind is, do I save money for that awesome no keys synth (and just plug it into the Brute, so I play it with the Microbrute instead of over MIDI, having a three oscillator setup), or just make do with what I can get from around here, in any case, I know that by the end of the story I will have way more synths than I should have. But don't take my word for it, just ask any synth enthusiast how many synths do they have, I'm sure that the story almost always goes like that. As always thank you for reading, watching, listening, whatever else you might have done this week while you looked at this page, and I will talk to you guys next week, on the regular schedule. (Probably)
