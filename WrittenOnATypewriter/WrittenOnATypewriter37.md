Hey there guys, this week I've been thinking a lot about synths again, even played a little just to get the rust off my fingers, and I caught myself wondering about the whole glitch music movement.

For those of you that don't know, Glitch music is a kind of music you make using nothing but synths, most of the time modular systems, that pretty much play themselves, you just have the hassle of being able to program the sound in you modular, remembering where everything goes, or even improvising every single time you play. It is weird.

No, seriously weird, stuff that could barely be called music, and still, it's so mesmerising, can't stop looking at it. I even have some glitch music composers that I follow avidly, with a passion, and I don't know why. So let's take a moment to dissect the whole thing and come up with an answer.

So, think about a orchestral play, it all starts very very simple, with a couple instruments underlying the main line of the song, which in the orchestra case means little to nothing, all the instruments can change whenever they feel like playing something else, but in sequenced synthesisers that is way harder to do in a pinch, which makes the changes to the song way slower and more organic, so that is a plus, kind of.

It also means that the songs are very experimental and progressive, never coming back to the same theme, or never leaving the original theme. That makes every glitch song weird to listen to while paying attention, it goes completely agains everything music has taught me ever since I started out playing.

Then, right after the overture there is a drop, where the song takes shape, where you introduce the Brass, the piano, whatever it is you are using to shape the soundscape of your piece, and in glitch music that never happens, the sounds are all added one by one, or in some cases two at a time, but never more than that, making it hard to pinpoint exactly where the chorus starts and the intro ends. That is the one that always breaks my head in two.

You are sitting there and you feel stuff changing, although you can't quite put your finger in it, and then all of a sudden you figure out that the song is way louder than it was thirty seconds ago, but the transition was so organic that you couldn't notice. Like when you come back home from a party and there is a ringing in your ear but it takes you a couple minutes to actually notice it.

The next part of a regular song would be the verse, where you take your time to expand on the line you've experimented on briefly before and take out everything but the bare minimum, so that the audience understands what it is that you are trying to convey. That also never happens, I mean, it kind of does, sometimes, but it depends.

Most of glitch music songs are all about exploring a line or a chord, and they usually last long enough to be the size of a regular song so yeah, you don't need to separate where is the intro, the chorus, the verse, it's easier for who is writing, but outside of movies and games, I can't see people really getting into that, there is usually no vocals (Which is not bad, but the general public likes to demonstrate that they know a said song, having vocals makes that easier) there are no "Sick Drops", there are no solos (I mean, the song genre is actually kind of a solo performance in of itself), there is nothing that can be even remotely compared to music that has been popular in any time.

And that is why it is mostly of a musician's genre, there are a lot of people that like to talks about glitch music, because it's fun to try to decipher what the musician was doing, and that is the way I listen to glitch music, trying to figure out how the noises I'm hearing came to be, and that is what makes it such a perfect musician genre. Take a listen to this playlist I found:

That describes perfectly what glitch music is, it is so indie that no one actually listens to, so amazing that no one understands, and so freaking weird that i'm really into it. Take your time to listen to the playlist, the amount of color and character in it makes it worth listening if you're open minded enough. As always guys, thank you for reading this week's column, feel free to hit me up on the twitters @trymeguilherme and until next week.
