Hey there guys, how have you been doing? This one is a little late this week, sorry about that, tons of stuff to worry about, but thankfully i've been thinking this week, like I do most of the time, about drones, and he usability of one.

Never used one, (or even seen one mind you) but from all the footage i've seen with drones, it gets pretty obvious that it's a really good method of self recording, especially if you use 3D Robotics Solo, that frames shots based on your position and haves so many automated features that you actually feel really in control of the footage you are taking.

Earlier today I've received a e-mail from 3dr, that stated that they are doing a full series using only the Solo, my first thought was "Oh that is so amazingly cool." The thought that followed was "that is ridiculously impractical."

Why? Well, think about it, have you ever seen unedited drone footage? of course not, the noise is pretty much unbearable, because it is basically a helicopter with four rotors. So why would you go in the trouble of having to re record every single said sentence in a movie or series? Because of the freedom of framing the shots however you want the to, it is the ultimate "Fuck you gravity" coming from the video producer side of the spectrum.

Going through the trouble of studio recording just for a proof of concept? Well that is kind of a far fetch, I don't see many people going through with that. Using it as a backup camera it's really useful, record the scenes with speech with a proper camera and for the cinematic added effect record with the drone.

What really kills my drone mood is the fact that there is no conceivable way to record audio from it, the noise of the rotors kills that possibility.

But even taking into consideration the useless audio, drone making companies always make sure that you will want one. It just looks so amazing, a shot taken from twenty meters up in the air is just so... Inspiring, it feels so professional, being able to Dolly from a close up without any kind of training, and even with some levels of perspective lock. Ditching the rollers alone is already a reason for me to want one.

There is another problem with it obviously. The footage dynamics is so different from a typical cinematic camera that the footage gets distracting, taking your mind away from the actual movie you are watching. I use right now a Black Magic Cinema camera, with three different lenses for different purposes, I love her, she is the cutest thing I have ever owned, but the time I have to spend in Resolve fixing the palettes so that it would look like the footage from the drone actually feels like is going to be a killer. Dropping my production speed like a boulder going downhill. Check out this short video we made a couple months ago:

Yeah I know, that one is mainly my fault for having an actual cinema camera instead of a canon like everyone else does, but it will make my life a little harder if I get a drone. I still definitely want one, but I will either have to get someone else to help me edit, or spend the time figuring out the presets that work for the go pro in Resolve.

Honestly? I will not be getting a drone any time soon, although I really want one. My short movies are not that great, but I pride myself in the sound in them, no post production or anything, just what the camera captured and what happened in the scene, I like to shoot it that way and for me it works, it may not be the best audio ever, but I love the way we are set up for recording and don't really want to change it.

But then again, what do I know? It may be better to shoot with a drone instead of a regular camera, I wouldn't be able to tell without using one. Have you had a drone? Do you like it? Tweet @trymeguilherme and tell me how wrong I am. As always, thank you for stoping by and until next week guys.
