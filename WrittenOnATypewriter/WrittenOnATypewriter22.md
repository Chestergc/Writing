Hey there guys, it has been a long week for me, watched a lot of videos and well i caught myself thinking about the moon landing. Yep, conspiracy theory time, on the right side of it for once.

Oh man, where do I begin? Let's go the easy way around, computers.

NASA had built a couple computers during the sixties, most of which because of the whole space race deal. The computer they eventually ended up with was designed at MIT and built by Raytheon, and had an astounding set of specs. For the time obviously, the computer had a whole 64KB of memory and the processor clocked at about 0.043MHz, amazing huh? Would you imagine how long it would have taken to edit a video on it? probably the same amount of time it would take to get a couple missions to the moon and back. Honestly, if you believe nasa would have the capacity (at that time) to edit a video to show on the television you clearly have never used a Commodore 64.

And then there are the pictures, as you may or may not know, they used film cameras on the trip, took a couple pictures and put the film back on the radiation shielding compartment. As you may notice some of the pictures are stupidly grainy and bad in general. The way films on analog cameras work is that there is a piece of paper with silver grains on top, as the grains decay due to the exposure to light the picture is captured. That leads to the important bit, the film that took the grainy bits was most likely Kodak's 2485, which had a ASA of 1600, meaning it could take some impressive almost pitch black pictures and still be the grainiest you can get while still retaining images in a 70mm film. (obviously joking, film got much much better before hipsters appeared)

The flag thing. Oh the flag thing. You know that there is barely any atmosphere in the moon? Noticed how I said hardly? Because there is an atmosphere, just not comparable to ours. The moon's atmosphere is really amazingly thin and being constantly bombarded by solar flares which makes the place extremely barren, having almost no atmosphere, and barely any gravity. Anything that happens in the place looks amazingly similar to things happening in vacuum, where the first law of motion applies gracefully:

>"When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at >rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an >external force."

And that means that, until an object encounters resistance, (be it by air, water, someone stopping the object or something standing in the way of the object) it keeps doing whatever it was doing, so when the astronaut touches the flag with his hand the flag keeps going for way longer than it would on earth, until the resistance from the thin atmosphere of the moon is enough to stop the motion started by the astronaut.

And the footprint thing, as I said in the last paragraph, the moon has barely any atmosphere and that leads to the softest soil you could imagine, the moon not having enough gravity to compress the grains on the surface makes so that whatever touches the surface scares it.

The last thing I want to talk about is also the stupidest I have ever heard in the history of stupid things being said in the world.

>"But there are no stars in the photos, so they must be fake"
>Troll, Internet - Whenever he wrote that.

I seriously doubt that people that post that really believe what they are saying, but here we go. Go outside right now, can you see the stars? You can? Take a picture and tell me what happens. OK I was kidding i'm not going to wait for you to tell me because I know what you will say, that the stars don't show up on the picture. That is because there is too much visual pollution in our planet, all the buildings and cities light up at night, (because people need light to see and stuff) and so you can't take a picture of the stars in the sky without using some ridiculous levels of long exposure, and by ridiculous I mean about a minute or two of capturing. And the same thing happens on the moon, but not because of light, because of the place itself. The moon is white right? So when light comes into contact with the surface the place lights up like a disco ball, bouncing light everywhere, making it hard see the stars, just like back home.

And just like that I lost interest and no longer cared about the moon, ha. Honestly stop trying to debunk the only good thing to come out of the cold war, it was really a good thing. And I still want to retire and go live in Mars for a couple decades, so stop that. As always, thank you for reading this week's column, and I will see you next week.
