#On the topic of abstraction

  There is an object in a room, this room has white walls and is perfectly lit
from all sides. This object has properties and these dictate the interactions
that are possible between each other and the room around the object.

  In this room time is irrelevant until the properties of the object begin
interacting with each other, time here has no meaning, and is a direct repercussion
of causality.

  Mathematics would describe this room perfectly by using a simple formula,
something along the lines of:
```
Room = (X \* Y \* Z)-(X^2 \* Y^2 \* Z^2)+(Object)
Where Object = {properties}
```
  The function perfectly describes the room, it does not need any supplemental
data for the description of the subject at hand, and for most people that would
be the end of that topic.

  Abstractions are useful for creating computable models of things we see in the
real world, allowing the user to compute and project the properties an object may
exhibit in the real world by using properly crafted abstract descriptions of the
objects being described.

  The whole idea behind programming languages is abstraction, the code you
provide your machine is an abstraction of an abstraction of an abstraction of
electric currents flowing through transistors.

  The object in the room is an abstraction, by abstracting the less necessary
adjectives of the object the observer is able to describe the room objectively and
reasonably, describing the concept of time and causality inside the room and,
for most purposes, outside of it.

  Properties assigned to the object have influenced the perception of the
system the object is in, it does not need gravity, it does not need time, it
probably doesn't even need particles to exist properly, and at the same time,
the decision of making causality a part of the system had made it so that time
becomes a factor of the room the object is in.

  This realization makes so that researchers can describe any system with a simple
set of rules that are easily comprehensible and expandable, if the researcher
needs the simulation to be more like the actual system he is modeling all he
needs to do is keep adding more properties to the object being described,
at which point he can compute and even extrapolate any set of events based on the
properties of the object making a simple and coherent description of the object
and the circle of events and consequences the object would be subject to given
new properties or new systems with different properties.

  Being able to calculate systems with arbitrary precision is one of the rules
for a Turing complete machine, the simplest test available for measuring how
useful a computational system is. The actual phrase describes this portion of the
test as the machine being able to have arbitrary memory space, meaning it could,
theoretically compute any closed system, or even in some open systems where the
variables are acquired from outside the room or object being described.

  Using the previously defined formula and adding properties the observer can
start to comprehend the usefulness of abstractions in commonly used systems. There
has been previously stated that the object described had properties, and causality
emerged from those properties, initiating the object with a simple set of properties
the researcher can begin to describe the system:
```
Room = (X \* Y \* Z) - (X^2 \* Y^2 \* Z^2) + (Object)
Where Object = {
  Volume = V,
  Mass = M,
  Velocity = K,
  Acceleration = Vector(A)}
```
  Now the object has a determinate set of properties attached to it, the Volume
of the room constrains the object's Velocity and Acceleration properties and
confine them to the inside of the room, where the object comes into contact with
the room's edges he will, undoubtedly come to a halt and change the vector of his
Acceleration.

  If more properties are added the object gets more complex and harder to describe
as properties begin overlapping and interacting with each other:
```
Room = (X \* Y \* Z) - (X^2 \* Y^2 \* Z^2) + (Object)

Where Object = {
Volume = V,
Mass = M,
Velocity = K,
Acceleration = Vector(A)
Resistance = Cd \* .5 \* r \* V^2 \* A
Weight = M \* G
Gravity = G
DragCoeficient = Cd
}
```
  Now with resistance and Gravity in the system, the object keeps adding more and
more terms to the room it is in, making the whole system more complex and making
simple assumptions hard to make, will the object now fall? Or will his Acceleration
overcome the Gravity and drag coefficient making the object reach the edge of the
room?

  With the simple generalized properties seen here the question is impossible to
answer, although we can make predictions based on the reality used to infer the
existence of said object, in the real world Gravity needs energy to be overcome
and the object as described by the properties it contains does not have any energy
so, the object will reach equilibrium in the XYZ coordinates that are closer to
the Gravity source.

  By using simple systems of rules and properties researchers are able to simulate
and describe any number of properties a system haves, making abstraction the most
important tool researchers have when it comes to investigating systems and objects
interactions.
