> Just _write_ something, anything, even if it doesn't make sense, even if you don't know if it should make any sense. That thing you're afraid to _write_ about, _write_ about __that__.

How do you tell people about things? How can you even care enough about someone to tell them the things you want to tell them? Everyone is a bit slow on the uptake when it comes to understanding other people, or even themselves, how do you go from being completely useless in a social dynamic to being a salesman for any pitch?

That is something going through my mind less and less as time goes by, it's completely useless to think about it like that, it's not something you can achieve without practice, kind of a contradiction, considering that most people that actually ask themselves this question have problems conversing with people.

The problem for me usually goes along the lines of "Give me a reason to care about you", "Okay, you're boring. I don't care anymore". I'm kind of a social reject because of it. I'm that guy that you used to see every weekend, at least twice, but that you never invited to your place to watch a movie or eat something because reasons.

I've never had any close friends, I mean, I used to think that I did, until the point I realized I've never had. I do talk about stuff though, all the time, all kinds of things and that makes it harder for people to actually be able to get close.

If I know this guy's whole life, what is there to learn about him?

There are a couple people that I let get close to me, in a level that I've never let anyone before. And that kinda ruins things.

The moment you realize the guy you're into has a weir fetish for blood and violence you kind of rethink your life choices. Being the awesome person I am, I can never bring myself to refute said claims and the people end up leaving because I can't be bothered to run after them.

Yes, this is about you. For once I've grown the balls to admit it. I really care about you woman, you're the best person i've met in years and I want to be closer to you at the same time I don't want to push anything.

It's so hard to think about life when you're not here. I seem to be living so far in vain hope that you will someday let me get closer. I don't want to care anymore. I was happier when I was the drunk pansexual that everyone has been with at least once.

The point is that I love to live life not caring about anything and I can't seem to do that around you. I've grown to enjoying every conversation we have and hoping for another one. That is too hard to deal with right now.

Don't think I ever told you this, but I've been kind of too happy for my own good this past few months. When anything happens it all comes back life a truck barreling down a empty highway. It always runs me over.

>Look, here is the deal, I was in shit when you've found me, I'm still in the same shit as I was before, but now the shit is at a comfortable temperature and I've gotten used to the smell to the point that I don't even feel it anymore.

Never thought I'd still be using quotes from my book five years on, kind of amazing to be honest. Not that anyone will ever read it, I've made it for myself and it's mine. That book is a good summary of my life.

I'm a drunk ex-musician that enjoys sex a little too much and is addicted to a dozen different things. A terrible person, as annoying as someone can be, smart enough to do anything, without the willpower to do anything.

Don't even know if that's about the book or real life anymore.

There are actually three books, one about the musician, one about the boss and the third one, about the doctor.

The musician is who I used to be, always with a cigarette in the mouth and kind of drunk on a motorcycle, with a single person he cares about and nothing to live for except his music.

The boss is, as the name implies, the next thing I was. He owns a business and haves quite a number of people he cares about, in the book those are the 7, the group he started the company with, including his wife. He never drives, never smokes, only drinks occasionally(read "Only in parties"), and he seems to be one step ahead of everyone else at all times.

The doctor is complicated. He doesn't care about people in the way that the other two did, he does it in his own way and people accept it because that's just the way he is. He is always completely drunk, he cares more about his AIs than he cares about almost everyone else, except his "whatever she is", the Witch.

She is also complicated, she is the one that hit the killswitch in the world. Unintentionally of course, but she did anyways. She intrigues him, showing him things he never even thought about, admitting her mistakes and making efforts to prevent whatever consequences there may be.

They never been in a "Relationship" to the letter, they just hang out a lot, she drops by the workshop whenever the doctor gets carried away in a experiment or research, forces him to eat and sleep every now and again, although the concept of polyphasic sleep seems to be bullshit for her.

After the end of the world they actually started to treat each other like actual significant others, which kind of says a lot about me, thinking about it.

The point is that he is a genius and completely unfit for any social setting. That's why she is so important for him, she knows where to go and what to say when they get there. They end up having sex, about a day before the doctor decides to run away and never come back. Have never properly finished that story, not sure if she should find him in the end, or if he should come back and try to deal with the whole situation.

That is where I am right now though. A couple inches from running away and never coming back.

> What if I stay? What will I be able to fix? Where will I go from there? Living fucking life as a mother fucking time bomb, just waiting for the next god damned fuse to go off. I'm done with this shit, I'll come back when I'm a better person. Maybe.
