# Brooming - The Evolution Machine

> "Autos, the solution to the "Transport object from point A to point B" problem." (CGP Grey [Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU))

Out of all the things people don't think about anymore BROOMSTICKs are definitely one that used to take up large portions of peoples time and although people think the broom hasn't changed much since its invention whenever long ago that was, it sure has evolved a lot and passed through the 3 evolutions a product can currently pass through. That got me thinking this might be a good topic to talk about since most people don't know (or just don't care enough to think) about that. Hence we'll go through, step by step, the lifetime of a product. 

Not just one product, the whole of a class of product, as far as we can go with an idea someone has somewhere and turning it into a thing we just assume existed forever and can buy for pennies out of cornershops. This one I'll apply to BROOMSTICKs, but this basic model can be traced for most products we have nowadays, or most products we will ever have because this is pretty generalized.

The process (or evolution of the product whatever you wanna call it), goes through 3 major gates, each one of those containing the life's work of someone very smart, or the combined efforts of hundreds of very smart people.

The first stage of a product is finding an issue. It can't be any issue though, it has to be something deeply engrained into you, something that makes your blood boil just thinking about it, something that is so outstandingly annoying you'd give up most of your lifetime just to not have to deal with it anymore (because if your product works, you will definitely give up large portions of your life to it) 

The first gate to go through is solving that issue (read with british accent for dramatic effect). Easy enough you might think and yeah for most issues it is, but there are thousands of problems that arise from solving other problems, since we tracing the BROOMSTICK the main problem was "there is dust and cleaning this by hand is annoying, so much so that people want a lot of money to do it and rightly so". 

So you take your time, your shoes filling up with sand day in and day out, you might have actually been already working on another person's problem, you might live in a cave and just think it'd be better to not have dirt on your pristine newly watered rocks, whatever the case you think about ways to solve it. 

You could just run water through the floor at all times, but then the floor would be wet, if you had wooden floors that would be terminal for them because water and wood don't much like one another. So you discard that idea. 

You could possibly just kick the dirt away, but you notice your feet being all flat don't really get into all the cooks and nannies, and besides that would all be for naught if you couldn't convince everyone that entered your home to do the same, because as it turns out the main bringer of dust is feet. 

ABOLISH ALL FEET. From now on if anyone wants to enter your home they must have no feet. That solves the whole issue, the feet are the bringers of the dust anyways. I wonder how is it that animals don't really deal with this. Oh look at that wolf there, he is kicking the dirt with the side of his paw to get to the stuff beneath it. Interesting how the dust adhere to his fur, I wonder if there's something to that. 

Then you do science to it. All the science. Turns out having fur is a big deal to brush stuff away, some of the dirt sticks to the fur and some doesnt, and that makes it way less effortful than barefooting all the dirt away, so for a while you just have a fur cloth on your desk to clean the more important stuff. After a while you might notice that the fur is loosening from the skin. Maybe if you stick the actual hairs to a piece of wood it would last longer, and so you do.

There it is, the product. The first BROOMSTICK. Probably not named that though, it's barely a stick, at this point it's not much more than a stick with hairs on the end. But it doesn't matter, smarter men than me have said time and time again "strive for progress not perfection", if you keep progressing in a sufficient pace for long enough you get to perfection acidentally. 

![A short stick with fur in the end](../Images/Image1.jpg "a short stick with fur at one end, not a broomstick") 

Now the next stage of your product: making it reproducible (hence industrializable). Funnily enough, this is the cheapest part of any product's life cycle. Anyone that has tried to bring a product to market will be laughing his ass off right now, but i'm not even joking that people don't know how much the rest of the lifecycle costs, its enough for whole countries to specialize in a single thing. Remember how nokia was almost 1/5 of the whole country's production? That is the level of money you need to sink into something if you want it to go through the whole lifecycle, and a products cycle is usually much much longer than its inventor's. 

You start by breaking down what it is that you're actually industrializing, maybe there is a plant you can use instead of the fur because fur is costly to make, being that you need to raise an animal to adulthood and that costs a lot of money. You might stumble into coconut leaves, if you think about it when they dry out they are quite stable and firm and a lot cheaper to farm than animals. If you make a small bundle of the thin leaves they are quite close to being like fur. So what you actually need is a field of coconut plants and some kind of wood, could be soft wood or something whatever is cheap right now (for the sake of completion I'll say you have an oak farm, but it could be literally anything). 

Now 3 things need to happen to get your BROOMSTICK to market, you need to plant the trees, they need to grow and be harvested, and you need to process them into the raw materials you need to make your BROOMSTICK. Processing wood is quite easy, cut tree down, dry it out, mill it into planks, chop planks. You might employ a third party company to do this and just buy the ready made sticks, or you can verticalize your process and do all the refining in house, eitherway it'll be quite expensive, so I assume you would like to keep the quality control of your product with you and setup your own woodworking for your new product. 

The coconut leaves are mostly the same, harvest the leaves, dry them, strip them into strings and tie bundles, honestly this part is much easier so since its also coming from a tree you just open another side of your new industry to make the dry leaf bundles. 

How to stick them together though? You could do what you did to the fur and just stick the bundle to the wood with some glue, but something(testing) tells you that it won't work with the same glue. But there is an easier way that will ease all your later issues if you employ it. So obviously you don't even know what that is and you go with the glue for now until you can think of something else (Striving for progress! I'm so proud of you, imaginary inventor person). 

Then all the stuff gets to you, you start to make the first ones. They fucking suck. Gods they are horrible to use and if you want to use them on the floor you have to be on all fours on the ground who the hell designed this piece of shit? Not even to mention the leaf bundles coming loose every five scrubs. I can't sell this. You think about giving up. Then you feel the sand in your feet and everything gets so annoying you keep going.

You make the stick longer to make it easier for you to brush the floor. Then you think it might be easier if there are more of those leaf things and it occurs to you you could use the leaves to tie them to the BROOMSTICK, just instead of making the bundles as you were making, you make them flat and tie them to the stick by the middle before folding the leaves down, then for some ridigity at the tip you tie it again over the fold, making a recognizably long version of your amazing product. (Yeah i'm skipping a lot of trial end error here, prototyping is a whole process that can take literal years)

![The Final BROOMSTICK](../Images/Image3.jpg "The Final BROOMSTICK")

Now with BROOMSTICK MK2 you make a couple dozen to check the market value of the product. People are slow on the uptake though, everyone hates change and no one wants to be the first to buy something. After selling a couple dozen though, it gets much easier to sell because its a good enough product that people would like to have (Again, I'm skipping details here, publicity and marketing are whole academic topics now, if someone cares I could talk about it but it's a long topic so I'll skip it.)

There it is. Your first product on the shelves of the local store. So cool to get to this point, having made something to make everyone's lifes better and now selling it for profit out of your own blood sweat and tears. Sitting there, next to that pipe for smoking and that weird, wait what is that? No wait, it can't be. Someone stole your design? How? You made it all yourself by yourself, they couldn't have!

Yeah, that is part of the lifetime of a product, being robbed. I'm joking obviously, you weren't robbed any more than you robbed that wolf that brushed the leaves with the side of his paw. Humans like to pretend stuff they do is more important than anything anyone else might ever do but it usually isn't. The whole purpose of making something is to have that thing evolve us into a better state, don't be angry, be better than everyone else. You invented it, there has to be something that you haven't thought you could use to improve it. 

This is a very fun part of the process, the arms race to git gud. Now that you have competition doing just enough isn't good enough anymore, you could either quit (probably retire with the money of the product you already sold, which is what most sucessful product inventors do), or you could double down (make a better product so people actually notice if they get the cheap copy, make something that is so expensive the brand becomes the product, make a function that no one else can replicate, mix and match all approaches for optimum performance), whatever you do the product will keep evolving with or without you and even though you were an important part of it the most you can ever be now is the owner of the oldest company that made your product, be the Mercedes of your own field. 

For most of human evolution this was the end of the cycle of a product, there was no technology that existed to make this better than human powered, making a simple tool for humans to use was the best anyone could hope for and people just got used to having to learn how to use new tools as they became available, which is great for inventors.

Maybe for once you do the right thing and open source your design. You already have money you don't know how to spend why would you need to keep making more anyways? Whatever happens the product keeps evolving, some time later someone figures out how to make plastic strings that work the same as your leave bundles so you start using those, maybe someone figures out that its quite cheap to paint the wood before varnishing it and you start selling it in various colors to appeal to A E S T H E T I C S people. Then the more you invest into your product the more you notice its glaring issues, the more the issues start to annoy you and you feel yourself at the workshop again, with sand on your toes and you need to fix it better, which leads you to the second gate a product goes through. 

The second gate is mechanization (Tan tan taaan). As the product kept evolving you might have noticed that it did its job well, but it was very dependent of the operator knowing how to use it properly. The nuances of your BROOMSTICK were lost on the ones that didn't understand it's intricate design experience and made it seem like bad decisions at the time because most people don't really use it. You might even have heard of some advancements in BROOMSTICK technology across the seas in other countries and maybe even on your own country and maybe some of them gave you ideas. 

Wouldn't it be great if you didn't need to guide the dust outside one bunch at a time? The current workflow of the BROOMSTICK is swiping dust into a pile, then swiping the pile outside and repeating until sufficiently clean. Wouldn't it be great if the dust could be piled up for longer? Well, obviously not because that would just mean bigger piles, but what if the piles were ON the BROOMSTICK??? So you start looking at technology and figure out how these new scientists are using VACUUM to move particles from one place to another, after a quick browse you find a patent for a vaccum system and start looking at it. 

You obviously can't have it be wholly pneumatic, you wouldn't sell a whole pump with every BROOMSTICK, even if you took the luxury brand option, the price of a pneumatic pump alone would eat all the profits. So you disassemble the idea of a vaccum and try to find a way to make it work mechanically, which as it turns out is easy enough, all you need is a couple gears and 2 opposing brushes, no vaccum required. 

> ![The BROOMSTICK DOUBLE!](../Images/Image4.jpg "The BROOMSTICK DOUBLE!")

The whole process of getting it to market once again makes you hire people to do it for you, you're barely at the factory anymore anyways, not like you'd enjoy that you're an inventor after all, not a blue collar worker whatever that means. A few months later the DOUBLE hits the market. The first mechanized BROOMSTICK. Its such a huge advancement in technology most companies buy whole fleets of DOUBLES for their cleaning crew to use. 

Once more you've made a great product, but this time you open sourced it first just in case people need it. (Yes i was gonna go with the global BROOMSTICK CORP here, but I decided I'd rather not so you're one of those walkaways, everything you make is open source)

A few more years pass, your design is going great, people still buy it because of the fleet management they had signed into accidentally by purchasing them in droves when it was released, you see electricity is taking off so you might start to actually implement a simple impeller after the double's blades to make the work a bit more reliable and actually make it have the vaccuum you've always thought it should have, so the VACUUM DOUBLE is born and once again people love it. 

> ![The First BROOMSTICK](../Images/Image5.jpg "The Vacuum Double!")

From here on out the evolution starts speeding up to the point that most of the advancements you can't even understand because as it turns out there are a lot of very smart people in the world and even though you probably could match all of them one on one you can't hope to match all of them at once.

New colors, lighter materials, better ergonomics(yes I too streched in my chair reading that, I know), better operation, more powerful impeller, everything is getting added on, the work that took our original BROOMSTICK hours takes our VACUUM DOUBLE minutes. You start tracking this too because you're a nerd, the marketing department loves the idea, "80% faster than the original BROOMSTICK". You can't help but laugh at them. Such a stupid thing to use as a catch phrase. Maybe you're getting old huh?

One day you are bored. Because boredom is the mother of invention, and you watch the first computers getting turned on. You think nothing of it, how could a calculator make your VACUUM DOUBLE better? That is your life now, you've dug your hole and you'll be in it forever. Oh hey turns out those computer thingys can play chess. Interesting. if you think about it using your VACUUM DOUBLE is a lot like chess from a high level. There are things you can do, things you can't, and places you can get to and places you can't. 

Then it hits you, the solution to the final issue of the BROOMSTICK, making it self operating, humans need not apply.This is the third gate, automation (This is the part where the machines take over the world).

Although we are at the start of this one, there are already a lot of product that crossed this gate, no reason to think one will be any harder than any other so you just get to working on your ROBOSTICK, such a good name it makes you giggle. 

You need a way to make it stand by itself, which is pretty easy to do, a way to make it see the place it has to clean (easier said than done), and a way to make it dump its dust. 

It Stands, It Vacuums, It Washes, it's the best broomstick you've ever laid your hands on. Not your hands though, no hands necessary for operation. You take the simple way to everything it needs to do, make a simple search algorythm for your ROBOSTICK to vacuum around, make it know when it hits a wall and change direction, that's it pretty much (Yes I'm skipping the details because robotics is complex af and although i have implemented the algorythms a couple hundred times by now this post is already to long for me to explain a* and why we shouldn't use it on robot vacuums).

And there you go, you have seen the end of life of your product. You can sell it, but you probably shouldn't, since the work of employees is no longer necessary you should lease him to places that want to clean with the robot. This is the point you retire. We tend to think there's always something better somethign to improve and although there is always something to improve (engineering guarantees that) the law of diminishing returns makes it not worth it after a while and after you got to the point that it doesn't need employees time anymore the only way to make it  better (in a capitalist sense) is to make it run more efficient, run on less electricity, make it charge itself, make a central collection system that disposes of the dust of all the robots on the network you can keep the company going indefinitely with that kind of thinking but the gains will be diminishing with each step, everything you do has to be branded as the best thing since you brought the BROOMSTICK to the market even though it maybe a 0.02% improvement in energy usage. 

Hopefully this is all open source and you've stopped giving a shit a long time ago otherwise you might go crazy, after a whole lifetime of creating a product and going through all the development gates of the product you might feel there's nothing youc an start because you know how long it took the first time and you're right. After this the rest is all bullshit. 

Seeing a product through all these steps is a major achievement, very few people can claim they have done so. Most people that can are in industry or in (funnily enough) vacuum cleaners. I hope this was a fun read, i know it was fun to write and edit. If anyone is interested on the two topics i skipped over i might go back and re-do those bits just to show how they work.
