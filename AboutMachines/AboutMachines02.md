# Sadism - The Sociological Machine

  > Because i'm stupid, sadistic and suicidal, hard to accept but that's the whole idea behind my motivations, now is the part for the radio station.

  >Mindless Self Indulgence - 3S

So, That is exactly what i'm feeling right now. Been quite a while since the last time a song could describe me perfectly, amazingly it was from MSI as well. Jimmy has a way inside my head in another level. I don't think that it helps that he has this many songs about no one caring about anything.

I mean, who hasn't spent a couple days pissed drunk thinking about using drugs and spending a whole months paycheck on it. I guess I should back up a little, it's not making all that much sense so far.

Yesterday I went out. I went with a friend of mine watch a show from some random guys that play some old rock and drink. I was already depressed and pissed off when I got there, so the night went downhill from there, as soon as the show ended the friends I've went with gave up on me and headed home.

As soon as they left so did I, went to a place I used to go, trying to restart everything from where I had left, found a friend there, he introduced me to some beautifully colorful characters and some amazingly talented friends and I fell in love the first time.

He was about my size, he didn't exactly talk to me so much as I jumped in the middle of a conversation they were having. He was a composer, such a stupid phrase, I guess he still is a composer, although I haven't been able to talk to him about it, he was... Handsome, weird to say that, but he was and his personality hit me in the heart like I haven't felt for a very long time.

So we decided to go around the block, to another party, just to see what was happening there.

On the way there I fell in love again, a simple girl, small, cute, with nothing that would call attention to her, and that caught me. She was just so... Normal. She was like I imagined I would be if I was a girl, kind of a junkie, kind of not giving a shit, wanting some good things to happen and actually going with the people she knew. It was so awesome, she talked to me a bit, it was fun. I felt old and boring around her, trying to look hip for the people around me like a fool.

Getting there took a while, every step we took we found someone else on the middle of the road, trying to figure out a better place to exist in that moment. In the meantime the amazing girl I fell in love with was still with us, but I was with a short attention spam due to alcohol and I fell in love six more times before we got there.

People are just so interesting, I felt amazing for a time, I taught them a couple fun mathematical tricks and they enjoyed the moment, it was such a good moment, we were all there, in the middle of the street learning how to tie a knot mathematically and how to notate the know we just did. Such an amazing moment.

Then I found some other friends, from the old band. I got sad for a bit, and then I remembered they also had amazingly complex personalities, that intrigued me and called on my sense of self to try and understand what and where they wanted to exist. They invited me to start playing again.

I talked to a security guard, met some more amazing people and was happy for quite some time after that. we picked up some more people to hang out with us and we walked for quite some time. Talking and discovering new ways to define sentience and complexity was one of the highlights of this part of our tour de force around downtown.  

When the sun came up I've decided on the two most interesting personalities around me and gravitated towards them, being annoying in the mean time because of my sadistic curiosity. I've watched everything that made them feel pain and it felt good, i've stared at everything that made them feel nice and it was amazing.

Then in the end we parted ways. I've headed home and they went to find a better place to exit for now. I miss them this moment.

>It was a good night, I fell in love with about fifteen girls, and ten different boys, I hugged a guy and it was the best hug I've got in my life. Hugged a girl as well, although after the guy she was somewhat disappointing. Fell in love with the personalities of so many people I didn't knew and loved every single one of them. I even miss them now. I've found friends, I've met strangers, I've felt fine, for the first time in a long time. I've loved and i've forgot, t'was the best night I've lived and the worst night I've lived. It was such a good night that I even forgot to acknowledge how good it was as it was happening. I've existed, for just that night, in that place, I was a thing that existed. I guess what I mean is that It was an emotionally draining night and I want more.
