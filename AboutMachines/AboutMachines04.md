# Entropy - The Time Machine

> Even though no pair of observers can't agree on what happened, in what order, or even where it happened, the thing they can agree on is the Space-time interval given by: (Sˆ2)=(Xˆ2)-(Cˆ2)(Tˆ2)

So, some of you may consider time to be an actual thing that happens, not a consequence of anything. Although most people actually consider it to be an extra dimension of some sorts(And that interpretation actually works with the numbers) most people just assume it's a thing that happens, if you exist, time moves for you.

Other people may consider the speed of light as a perfect measurement of time. It also makes sense, it's a constant and it never changes, but mostly people assume that the speed of light is just that, and are confounded by the reason why we use the letter C to represent it in our formulas.

Today I would like to tell you why we do that, and in the mean time I just want to get some things off my chest, just to make myself feel a bit better about things in general.

So, first of all, the speed of light has absolutely nothing to do with light. Light is not a constant and in theory, if you fiddle with a couple of numbers it can have arbitrary speed. The reason we agree that light has constant speed is that if you look at our specific arrangement of constants it does.

But, what defines light-speed is not light, it's causality. You can actually think about it like the french guy did in the matrix movies, causality is the root of life and time is a consequence of it, not what causes it.

The good thing about being human is that we have imagination, we can think about things without being bogged down by god damned real life physics, and in doing so we create loops and time machines and meaningless although thoughtful experiments that prove for reason a or b that what we do matters.

And that is exactly what my mind does, every single day, every single waking moment of every single day.

I remember that we are all arbitrary in nature and that in the moment we die nothing will change for anyone in the universe.

In the deepest parts of my mind I want to be wrong, I want to be the hero of the movie, I want to search for meaning and get an answer from the universe, but as Camus said in one of his works, life consists of two irreconcilable facets, the human tendency to look for meaning in life and the universe's complete indifference to our existence.

Every single one of us can spend a whole life trying to come up with meaning, trying to rationalize the universe by using formulas and words, and the universe will just ignore it all. Not because it's evil, not because it hates us, just because we are all insignificant to it's existence.

Questioning the speed of light is the simplest way to see the amount of indifference we're treated to in our lives. We see something, we think it's a fixed point in our comprehension and then the universe just ignores us, keeps doing it's thing. And when later we figure out that it had nothing to do with anything, we struggle to cope with it.

>They deify what crushes them, and find reason to hope in what impoverishes them.

That is what guides a pretty good portion of life, seeking meaning in meaningless things, trying to come up with something to hold on to, be it religion, science or anything else in between.

Quite a few times in my life I have given meaning to myself by trying to make someone happy and then it ends. Try all as you might, everything ends, it may last for a day, a year, a decade, a century, but in the end it was all just a ploy to seek meaning in a questionable existence that hates you for actually living.

Time is like that. What difference does time make if nothing ever changes? Imagine a black room, with no windows or doors and nothing in it, does time exist there?

It doesn't, because time, just as anything else, is a finite measure of causality. If nothing happens causality has no meaning, time doesn't exist. And even if it exists in that place, it doesn't make a difference, for there is no one to appreciate it.

And then we have the brain, fumbling for a meaning in this existence and completely disregarding all rules of the universe in favor of his own quest.

I've met people that said they couldn't live without their significant other, on one occasion or two i've even been that person, and the common denominator in all those people was that they made a point to seek meaning and in being ignored they idealized what made them hurt.

I had a person I loved back in the day, she was smart, amazing, beautiful and complicated, studying her behavior had kind of given my life meaning, until it didn't anymore.

Causality took over my mind and I could only think about how much life is meaningless. I could talk to a random person for hours about politics and just at the end of the conversation realize the meaningless conversation we just had. Every action I took lead to the same ending, every turn seamed to get me closer to some undefined ending and I didn't want that to happen.

Time and space had switched roles. In my head I was making my own choices out of my own volition, and then when I looked back at it, I didn't, everyone else seemed to have more control over my life than I did.

And I just quit. Got depressed for a while. Driven by my imaginary needs and wants. Living every single day as a way to kill time until the next bottle arrived.

And now. I got over it. Life makes no sense, sure, causality rules everything, yes, no one exists on purpose, no one belongs anywhere, everyone is going to die.

In seeking meaning in life I've came across meaninglessness and it was comforting. Life is no longer complicated, everything has a reason and nothing really matters.

It seems depressive, it seems a bit cynical, maybe a destructive way of thinking about things, but I assure you that this is the happiest thought that ever crossed my mind.

If nothing means anything, it means that nothing needs to be changed, you need to do nothing, you don't need to force yourself to talk to anyone you don't want to. And isn't that a happy thought?
