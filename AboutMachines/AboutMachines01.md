# As time Passes by - The Social Machine

Hey there people. There has been quite a while since the last i've seen any of you and probably it's time to start communicating again. You know how life works don't you? Time passes and you forget about places and people, and you start considering other places and other people important because for some reason at that time it doesn't really make sense to dwell on what was or what could have been.

And then a couple years later you start to reminisce and decide to go back to those places you were in and to those people that once meant everything to you, you know what happens then? Time hits you in the face, with the strength of a dozen bulldozers and you are, all of a sudden, at a lost as to what to do. You miss the people, the places, the hangovers, even the god damned fights where way more fun than they are right now, and there is nothing you can do about it. Time moved while you weren't looking and you just want it to stop and leave you alone, and it won't.

You don't deserve this. You've always been a good person, treated everybody nicely and even costly swallowed your pride time and time again to make sure that people would enjoy being around you. But, of course, you do deserve this. You are the one who locked yourself out of the world and nothing you can do about it now will change anything.

Then comes the hard part, how to accept that? It's not going to go away if you don't think about it, you need to deal with it. Deal with not having any friends, not having any skill on the "real world", not making nearly as much money as you would need to survive. And yes, it is not easy.

As you may be able to tell, this year has been quite a busy one for me. I am a loathing blob of a person, stuck on a stupidly comfortable computer chair writing for completely unknown people while downing a dozen cups of coffee a day. It's not healthy, not even good, but i have nowhere else to be, no one else to see and nothing else i rather do.

And the interesting part is that i actually miss all of it. Everything that once was is still fresh in my mind, like that time I got mad when she lifted your skirt, that time i punched a wall trying to light up a cigarette, that time you jumped on my back and i carried you for half an hour, that time you just hugged me and made it all go away, that time we spent eight hours speaking nonsense and drinking Irish coffee. Everything that has ever happened is still happening in my mind and i want it all back, but i seem to be the only one.

I am sick and tired of all of this. Back in the day I had nothing, and i was happy. I'm stressed out.
