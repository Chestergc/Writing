# Technology Tree - The Routing Machine

> Pick an end point, any end point, and focus on it.

There's been quite a shift in the way life works now. I've been alone for so long that I really started to hate everyone in the world. It's quite an interesting development. I've always thought I hated everyone, although I had no idea what that actually meant.

I've written down my tech tree, the route to take from here, it's a huge panel stuck to my wall, right in my face in a way I can't possibly ignore it. Pretty complex to be honest.

> Electronics Lab

It starts pretty simple; Electronics lab. I need an electronics lab to be able to do anything I feel like doing so it's a great place to start, seeing as it's the most obvious place for me. I've designed it, you could say that the research is done, now I just need to produce it.

> Robotics Lab | Eurorack

Then it branches pretty hard, the next thing on the tree is technically a robotics lab. I really want one to be honest, being able to produce mechanical pieces in my lab is a necessity as I'm too into robotics to not try it. Next to it, my Eurorack. Quite a hard to make, quite complicated, will probably take years, haven't even been able to start the research on that to be quite honest.

Then the crazy split, the breaking point, the part that defines whether or not I'm able to finish this.

> Gamedev|3dPrinter|Delta

That will be quite hard, whatever path I take, the printer is pretty much already done, just quite hard to come up with the materials, as I can't produce most of it without my robotics lab. Gamedev is in the wrong place to be honest, it needs some tech that is below to really be feasible, as my computer is nearly dead by this point. Seven years of life and the little thing is still chugging along, hard to believe.

Delta is one of my autonomous machinery projects. Not gonna talk about him.

Then from here on out it gets crazier and crazier. Everything being completely doable of course, but no one would even try it because it's too much work, that's my biggest sin I suppose, trying everything at least once.

> The Doctor and The witch|Cyberdeck|Hip

The doctor and the witch. Such a good name. I've had the script and design documents for that game for as long as I can remember, this will be the part that I try to make it properly. Even though most of the things in the game have been done to death already. It's my game, for me.

The Cyberdeck is pretty self explanatory. I want a Cyberdeck, a proper one, that can interface with anything in the world and has a useful processor and is fast enough to do anything.

Hip is delta's younger brother.

> Alianthus|AMPROC|Ziziphus

Alianthus. Here's the part where the latin names come in, kind of used to naming things like that, quite an unusual name for a processor, the idea is to make a complete 32 bit single core processor. Or at least design one and have it made somewhere, about here is where the robotics lab needs to be upgraded, maybe being able to produce wafers and stuff, just to that I don't need to outsource the processors.

Additive Manufacturing Production Center; AmProC, as the name suggests, a production center. Quite complicated to make, but it's doable, taking from the 3d printer all that I would need is new and more useful tools, being able to work with different materials and a number of production sensors.

You can guess what Zi is by now.

> Alianthus II|Scribe|Logistics Lab

The second part of the processor is to try and make it a proper 4 core 64 bit modern one. Not completely unfeasible, but hard. taking from the original one I think it's not too much of a leap to be able to make one.

The scribe is a modern smartphone to slot into the Cyberdeck, much like microsoft wanted to make, I want it to be a modular phone with a seriously good desktop grade processor. I wanted it to be like a speed module for the deck.

Aaaand here is where I lost it completely. Technically a Logistics Lab deals with automated packaging and transport, so Autos and packaging machinery. For this to work I need to know an awful lot about AI and industrial grade machinery, shouldn't be too hard, but hey it's me.

> AMFAC

Additive Manufacturing Fully Automated Corporation; AmFAC. One of those cases where the acronym is way better than the phrase itself, AmFAC is supposed to be a "portable factory", something small enough to slot anywhere and start producing whatever you need. Quite complicated. The idea is that you take inputs, like iron ore or something, and in the output of the machine there is your product, packaged and inserted into an Auto, ready for transport to wherever it needs to go. That is my end goal.

Dropping the cost of a factory to maybe a thousand pounds, making sure that anything can be produced anywhere. Even if it's not as efficient as a normal factory it could change things, making raw materials the most useful thing anyone could ever have.

It's doable. Kind of. Maybe. Ok, it's doable with modern tech, without a shadow of a doubt, if you think about it as a mathematician, I should at least give it a go.

See how little social interaction there is in my path? Pretty interesting huh? It's perfect the way it is, my babies with me and fuck the world. Put AmFAC on a ship and go straight to the asteroid belt, just to be sure no one can find me.
