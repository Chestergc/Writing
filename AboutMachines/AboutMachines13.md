# Society - The Consumption Machine

> Is a man not entitled to the sweat on his brow? (Andrew Ryan)

A little while ago in North America a thought was echoed through the whole country, when it was instituted that companies and people would pay taxes to lower the burden on poor people. Most of the company owners renegaded the thought in favor of not paying taxes, making it so that the gap between people got wider and wider as time went on. Slavery, poor working conditions, starvation, everything was at an all time low in the continent because of the introduction of taxes and the way the richest men decided to take it.

The game I cited at the start of this post is the main take away from the era, people actually thought like the fictional character Andrew Ryan, there were countless philosophers that valued the government as nothing more than a way to keep the lower classes in check; Stating to the top of their lungs that "The government should not meddle in private affairs" and "Who are they to dictate what I can or can't do with my property?".

That thought process was, and still is, pretty flawed, but as all things worth thinking about you could see why they thought that.

Having had quite a while to think about the government and everything going on in the country they just forgot how they got there. Yes, the lack of taxes, but also the people, the working class, the slaves that they so adamantly maintained that "Couldn't survive on their own, so I'm doing them a favor".

For a country made up of refugees and criminals the United States surely forgot about who they were quite quickly. "God Bless America" was a phrase that was touted literally everywhere, emphasizing the idea of American supremacy, a country made by god, for the people of god.

Obviously they were, and still are, wrong. America is a good place yes, but a person need only look at the death rates and statistics to see through their "amazing country".

America is, right now, what the United Kingdom was during the conquest period. A place where everyone wants to be, but to the people that actually are there, a menial life of servitude and disappointment.

> There's a hole in this world like a great black pit that's filled with people who are filled with shit and the vermin of the world inhabit it.

That line was written about London, but there are quite a number of people that would agree it fits with America.

Contrary to what it may seem I don't hate the United States, they did what they could with what they had, but the supremacy thing is still in place for the regular resident, the complacency of the people is quite astonishing, even in today's society where we see an all time low trust on the government and companies most people can't even be bothered to vote.

Not their fault obviously, they just assume (and rightly so) that a single people's vote wouldn't amount to much, because of the way the system works. Everyone knows how bad the problem with the American voting system is, people not voting for candidates, but instead voting for a person to vote for them. It made perfect sense back in the foundation of the country because the fastest way to send a message was to put a guy in a horse and tell him to run as fast as his horse could take it, but now it is a hinderance.

There are ways to fix it, and much smarted people than me have talked about it, especially on youtube, but that is not my point right now. The point is that, the current way most societies are arranged only makes it so that people feel more distant from the government.

Large societies may be unavoidable, after all people do enjoy being in groups although the group itself hinders them quite dramatically. People want to be included in a group because, for a human being, being part of a society actually improves the chances of survival quite drastically. But then what do we do when that is no longer the case?

People are amazing, we have for so long been able to create and mold everything around us, getting to the point that we are better at making machines that make things than the things itself. We will, inevitably get to the point that societies no longer are useful, when people no longer need anything the government might be able to provide, when every single person can be able to create everything they need to live and prosper, engaging in trade because it's fun to interact with people, not out of necessity.

Is a man entitled to the sweat on his brow? If the government can't provide anything I need, should I still be a part of society? If my land is mine, and it's self sufficient what is the purpose of paying taxes? What if I don't need the medical attention, or the security of a government to survive?

Should I just distance myself from society then? What if the only thing society can provide me with is people to interact? Can the government claim ownership of social interaction? Should it? Will I have to pay for the privilege of interacting with people in the streets? Why would I pay taxes for my land if the whole system was put into place by me?

If I had the technology for water treatment, power production, food production, housing, amenities, what can society offer me? There are ways to keep the "Institution" running, just the focus would be quite different. Making it so that most of the taxes come from transactions involving intellectual property. But then again, would people be ok with that?

If the only thing society can tax me on is something I have made and regulated myself, what is the point of having a society? Sure, the laws are quite useful, a contract that says that I shouldn't kill people, and I won't be killed as long as I don't kill anyone, but then we could just open source that and everyone is allowed to opt out of it. Maybe we got to the point where being able to do something general is not as useful as being able to specialize in a single type of thing, then you can sell blueprints and people make it themselves, making use of automated production and assembly systems that are falling in price so fast that no one is even able to keep up.

I'm suspect to talk about that, I have a laser cutter, a mill, a 3d printer and a lathe next to my bedroom and there is very little that I can't produce myself, when we get to the point that you don't need to create it yourself is where this takes place.

If you can imagine a home producing everything that it needs you can see what I'm talking about. For me, right now, I don't need society anymore. Can you compel me to stay with it?
