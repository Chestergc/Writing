>In my head, I see you all over me. You fulfill my fantasies. It's going down.

So, How are you? I'm dead inside. Fuck me right?

I miss you, you know that right? There is a good reason for me to not speak.

It's not that I hate you, or anything, I just. Yeah. Fuck this. I love you.

In my head, I can see we talking again like we used to. Like life used to let us. Like all things used to happen. I think that sometimes I just think that to make myself feel better.

We're so fucking different. I wanted different, totally my fault, again.

Again.

And I can't come out of this on top. At all.

You know all those shits I didn't give about life and the world? How I completely ignored the universe? And how I screamed a huge fuckit to everything in my life? They all ended up in you.

I seem to give more of a thought about every single word I say to you than I do to every living moment I have in my life right now.

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

WHY CAN'T I THINK LIKE I USED TO?

WHY THE HELL CAN'T I BE LIKE I USED TO?

Would you be able to guess who is drunk?

Hah.

I suppose that's nothing new by now.

Baby I want out. Just thought you should know.

Sorry. I love you. Hope you live a good life.
