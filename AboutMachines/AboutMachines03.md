# Loving - The Emotional Machine

>"What difference does it make if I'm seeing someone? I just want to see you well."

How do you make someone understand you? How do regular people think about life and the universe and everything? Does everyone go for the same standards as I do?

Well of course it makes a difference, how would you feel if the single most important person in your life all of a sudden left you and started hanging out with random people from bars?

I can't complain to be honest, life has been amazing for quite a long time so far, and I was due to a dose of sulking and general loathing. Although that doesn't make me feel any better, it's not supposed to anyway, I feel really bad right now and I want to just be over with as soon as possible.

>"No one exists on purpose, no one belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die, come watch TV?"

That line got me over the edge. The emotional machine is a complicated device. It takes you over like a storm and all of a sudden you are being controlled by short bursts of happiness in the middle of a sea of depression and sulking. You could actually say that anyone would be better off without hormones, you could actually be right, but that is not what fixes it.

In my head everything that has ever happened is still happening all the time in the deepest parts of my own mind, time is a construct and entropy is ignorable. Every time you remember something, you just remember the feeling and the way stuff was at the moment. When I do it, I live it all over again, the smells, the sounds, the tastes, the context, everything makes it's way inside my head when I remember something.

That is what gets me over it, the possibility to relive it. Being able to remember the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of the story, making sure that I remember every individual detail in all possible scenarios. Being able to do so only hinders my capacity to let it go.

I'm not an emotional man, haven't been that way for quite some time, I feel like every time I let my emotions get involved in anything things turn to worse and it cripples my capacity for handling anything, I have a terrible fear of certain places and my mind is not able to cope with not knowing things about it.

Been talking to someone lately, trying to feel nice and impress someone is the most emotional thing I let myself do on a regular basis, don't really think that anything should be able to carry me like that but that is for the best. I haven't got the mental capacity for anything else right now.

I know I should stop, I know I need to stop. but I won't. I want to feel wanted for a little while. Feel like I matter for someone else that isn't inside my head. I know I can't do that. That doesn't stop me from trying though.

>Being emotional hinders the mental capacity. I would rather be analytical any day but I am at the mercy of my own body and it desperately wants to reproduce and keep living.
