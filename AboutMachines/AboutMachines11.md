# Sci-fi - The Scale Machine

> The part most sci-fi writers struggle to grasp is the vastness of space.

Science fiction is fun, quite an entertaining topic, loosely grounded on reality, talking about how things could be in a specific setting, discussing the times to come. It is no coincidence that it's my favorite setting for any kind of story, you could probably sell me a soap opera as long as it's kind of sci-fi. And that's the reason why it hurts me to the core that most of them fail to grasp the sheer size things could be.

The possibilities a civilization have are nearly endless, and for all intents and purposes all of them are viable in one way or another. Thinking about that I have come across Warhammer 40k in the last few months. Such a good concept for a series, especially for a tabletop game, I think a short summary should help for people that actually care what I'm on about.

So, as the title suggests, the series is currently in the fortieth millennium, the human race is still alive and kicking and we are kind of okay? That's when we get to the tagline for the series:

> In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.

That is the main tag for the series, humanity being screwed from all ends by endless "xenos" (the series's name for aliens) wars break out on every major planet pretty much daily and the planets that are actually safe can be counted on one hand's fingers.

In this universe humankind is (arguably) the main dominant force on the galaxy, boasting an feudal cast based imperium with over fifty million colonized planets.

And here we get to the main stumbling wall for any science fiction writer, the scale of the conflict is too small.

There is one piece of advice I can give to anyone trying to tell a galactic story; Whatever are you thinking, make it bigger. There isn't  single story I have ever read that actually depicts an actual K2 civilization, and that is a pretty sad thing to think about seeing as in most science fiction we are pretty comfortable with introducing parallel universes and extra spacial dimensions at every corner.

I can hear the writers boasting the imperium as the biggest sci-fi society ever, and they are not wrong, but it could be so much bigger, so much cooler.

> Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.

Fifty million inhabited planets. Such an imposing number, unless you start to think about it and figure out that is about 1% of the size of our galaxy. Trillions of inhabitants sounds like a huge number, until you realize that is supposed to be the population count of a single K2 star. Sacrificing thousands of people a day to keep the emperor alive sounds like a lot, but then, what is a thousand people when the imperium in it's own right should have quadrillions of people being fed and housed daily, without even considering people that would die that day anyways.

Oh yes, it's quite a dark setting for a story. There is a meme making the rounds around the internet, about fandoms, the gag is asking different fandoms if they wanted to live in the setting, Harry Potter fans would, Star Wars fans would, Star Trek fans would, Warhammer fans wouldn't, at all.

>The martyr's grave is the keystone of the imperium.

Whatever you think is big, 40k is bigger and bolder, until you figure out that the biggest setting ever imagined is still orders of magnitude off of what could actually be comfortably possible according to know science.

And it's not like i'm picking on 40k, even Asimov's foundation series is not big enough, it's way bigger than 40k, and I'm positively sure it's the closest we've ever got to a K2 civilization in popular media, but even Asimov's setting is at best a 1,7 on the Kardashev scale.

The point I'm trying to make in this post is: We are able to come up with scientifically sound ways for entire civilizations live off of black holes without any stars shining, why are we stuck on the sizes we can imagine? I want a story set in a Dyson Swarm around Alpha Centaury, I want a war between two K3 civilizations, where every scout unit has dozens of billions of soldiers, I want humans hooked up to control systems that can influence the outcome of a coin toss three systems away by shooting a 5v laser pointer, people born with the skill to understand higher dimensions, computers with the whole sum of human knowledge that are the size of a coin and work by encoding information into a black hole's event horizon in a parallel dimension, there are just so many possibilities we are completely ignoring and I want someone more creative than me to come up with cool stories for those settings.
